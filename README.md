 # Urban Garden Planner

Welcome MongoDB + Spring Boot Micro Project!

A RESTful API to help urban gardeners plan and track their plantings.  Instead of a shop or library example, this will 
let users store and retrieve information about the plants they want to grow, their care instructions, and seasonal notes.

### Goal of the Assignment
- Learn how to integrate Spring Boot with MongoDB Atlas 
- Understand RESTful API design 
- Practice data modeling in MongoDB 
- Apply algorithmic thinking to CRUD design 
- Work with real-world inspired domain

###  Background Explanation
Urban gardening is growing in popularity. But many gardeners struggle to track:

- Which plants they want to grow 
- Planting dates 
- Care instructions 
- Notes about growth and harvest

Task: Design a REST API that lets users store and manage their personal urban garden plan.

Each **PlantPlan** record contains:

| Field          | Type    | Description                         |
| --------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------- |
| id              | String  | Unique identifier                   |
| name            | String  | Name of the plant                   |
| plantingSeason  | String  | Recommended planting season         |
| sunlightNeeds   | String  | Sunlight requirements               |
| wateringFreq    | String  | How often to water                  |
| notes           | String  | Additional notes                    |


###### Why This Project?

1. ðŸ‘‰ It uses real-world thinking (planning, storing structured info)
2. ðŸ‘‰ It requires NoSQL design (flexible, schema-less)
3. ðŸ‘‰ It aligns with REST principles (resources, methods)
4. ðŸ‘‰ It will teach you step-by-step how to:
    - Model data
    - Create a Spring Boot project
    - Connect to MongoDB Atlas
    - Expose REST endpoints
5. ðŸ‘‰ Practice advanced REST design
6. ðŸ‘‰ Learn custom queries in Spring Data MongoDB 
7. ðŸ‘‰ Add update and delete endpoints 
8. ðŸ‘‰ Add validation for data integrity 
9. ðŸ‘‰ Add calculation endpoints for real-world value
