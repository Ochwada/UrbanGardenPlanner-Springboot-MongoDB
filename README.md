 # Urban Garden Planner

Welcome to your MongoDB + Spring Boot assignment!

A RESTful API to help urban gardeners plan and track their plantings.  Instead of a shop or library example, this will 
let users store and retrieve information about the plants they want to grow, their care instructions, and seasonal notes.

### Goal of the Assignment
- Learn how to integrate Spring Boot with MongoDB Atlas 
- Understand RESTful API design 
- Practice data modeling in MongoDB 
- Apply algorithmic thinking to CRUD design 
- Work with real-world inspired domain

###  Background Explanation
Urban gardening is growing in popularity. But many gardeners struggle to track:

- Which plants they want to grow

- Care instructions 
- Notes about growth and harvest

Task: Design a REST API that lets users store and manage their personal urban garden plan.
